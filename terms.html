            <h2>14. Geographic Restrictions</h2>
            <p>RecipeAI is operated from the United States. We make no representation that the Service is appropriate or available for use in all locations. Access to the Service from territories where the content is illegal is prohibited. If you access the Service from outside the United States, you do so at your own risk and are responsible for compliance with local laws.</p>

            <h2>15. Dispute Resolution and Governing Law</h2>

            <h3>15.1 Governing Law</h3>
            <p>These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the United States and the State of California, without regard to conflict of law principles.</p>

            <h3>15.2 Arbitration Agreement</h3>
            <p>Any dispute arising from these Terms or your use of the Service shall be resolved through binding arbitration rather than in court, except that you may assert claims in small claims court if they qualify. The arbitration will be conducted by a neutral arbitrator in accordance with the American Arbitration Association (AAA) rules.</p>

            <h3>15.3 Class Action Waiver</h3>
            <p>You agree that disputes will be resolved individually and not as part of a class, consolidated, or representative action. You waive the right to participate in class actions or class arbitrations.</p>

            <h3>16.1 Entire Agreement</h3>

            <h3>16.2 Severability</h3>
            <p>If any provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary, and the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect.</p>

            <h3>16.3 No Waiver</h3>
            <p>Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.</p>

            <h3>16.4 Assignment</h3>
            <p>You may not assign or transfer these Terms or your account without our prior written consent. We may assign these Terms without restriction.</p>

            <h3>16.5 Force Majeure</h3>
            <p>RecipeAI shall not be liable for any failure or delay in performance due to circumstances beyond our reasonable control, including acts of God, natural disasters, war, terrorism, pandemics, or third-party service failures.</p>
